- Hi, I'm Alessandro and as you read before in the giant sign above I'm a Front End Developer
- I have 5 years of experience building modular and responsive website design
- Right now my focus is on improving and developing my skills, but I'm always interested in trying new stuff out and learning more. <br />
- I have many side-projects and ideas to realize and hopefully they will see the light soon, so stay tuned! <br />
